## What to Expect
We get it, church can be scary, especially when you don’t know what you might get yourself into. At Flatland Church we’re all about helping people move closer to the center of God’s Kingdom, where we believe real life transformation happens. As a result, you’ll start to influence your friends, family, and neighborhood.

- Flatland 144 is located on 144th Street half-way between Maple and Fort, right across the street from Buffet Middle School.
- Worship experience is typically 60 minutes long.
- Don’t worry, you’re not running late, we end with singing each week so everyone has a chance to respond to the message by worshiping God.
- You’ll leave our services full of hope and inspiration to live the abundant life God offers through faith in Jesus Christ and the power of His Holy Spirit.

**What do I wear?**

Wear what makes you comfortable. Most folks come in jeans and button-down shirts. Even our pastors teach in jeans most weeks.
